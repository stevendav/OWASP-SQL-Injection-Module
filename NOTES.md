Dear Recruiting Team,

Thank you for this opportunity to create this module. It was challenging, educational and a pleasure to complete.

I thought it might be benegifcial to give you some insights into my thought process and my challenges as I worked through this excersice. 

## Thought Process
A blank canvas or in this case a blank module can be one of the most challenging obstacles to overcome. Given the opportunity to create a module on whatever I was passionate about teaching 


came up with two scenarios:

1. Create and deploy a crypto miner in AWS and use the DataDog Agent to detect and alert on it.
2. Illustrate the Impossible Time Travel scenario, where a user logs into AWS from Los Angeles and then from Madrid 15 minutes later. Again, using  DataDog's security tools to detect and alert around this.

As I began to explore scenario one, I quicly realized that not only would this be difficult to keep to 15 minutes, but also given my current resources it would be extremely difficult to build out in a module.

The second scenario seemed more plausible. I bult my AWS EC2 environment out, got my DataDog agent running successfully. However getting SIEM up and running proved more challenging. Spinning up all the necessary AWS services with CloudFormation and CloudTrail would again take more time and resources than I had and would also be difficult to keep to under 15 minutes for a module.

Having just been through some recent security training I settled on
